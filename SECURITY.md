# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly by emailing **tableaprogramming@gmail.com** instead of using the public issue tracker. This allows us to assess the risk, fix the vulnerability, and release a patched version before the details are made public.

Please provide the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Suggested fix (if any)

We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge and fix the vulnerability promptly.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 0.1   | ❌ No              |

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1) when vulnerabilities are discovered. We recommend upgrading to the latest version as soon as security updates are released.

## Dependencies

This project uses automated dependency scanning via Dependabot to keep dependencies up-to-date and to alert us to any known security vulnerabilities. Security fixes in dependencies will be promptly addressed.

## Code Scanning

This repository uses CodeQL to perform security scanning on all code changes. All pull requests are scanned for security issues before being merged.

## Best Practices

When using text-to-qti:

- Keep your Python environment and dependencies updated
- Use this tool only with trusted quiz files
- Be cautious when processing quiz files from untrusted sources
- Report any suspicious behavior or security concerns
